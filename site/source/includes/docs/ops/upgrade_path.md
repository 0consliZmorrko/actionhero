# Upgrading ActionHero
Keeping up to date with big actionhero projects is no easy task. Every actionhero version has Its own specific project files which you generate using `actionhero generate` command. One of the ways to upgrade your project is to generate a new project using the latest actionhero framework (`npm i -g actionhero`). Using that as your starting point you can then carefully copy all your `configs`, `initializers`, `servers`, links or some other custom code from your old project, making sure that you are at the same working state as before. It's a good practice to make tests for your actions (or any other component) before you plan to upgrade your actionhero project. With tests you can make sure that you have successfully upgraded your project.
