## Step 1: Locate the BmEngine.ini file
 
The first step is to find the BmEngine.ini file in your game folder. This file contains the configuration settings for the game engine, including the language option. To find this file, you need to open your Documents folder or navigate to C:\Users\\*Your Username\*\Documents. Note that if your Windows installation is on a different drive letter, you will need to use that instead.
 
Once you are in your Documents folder, go to Square Enix > Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY > BmGame > Config. Inside this folder, you should see the BmEngine.ini file. Right-click on it and choose Open with > Notepad or any other text editor.
 
## Step 2: Edit the Language option
 
The next step is to edit the Language option in the BmEngine.ini file. To do this, you need to scroll down until you find the line that says Language=. This line determines what language the game will use based on a 3-letter code. For example, if Language=DEU, then the game will use German as its language.
 
If you want to change the language to English, you need to set Language=INT. This stands for International English and is the default language for the game. If Language= is set to nothing or an unsupported language, then the game will also use English as its language.
 
After you have changed Language=INT, save the file and close it.
 
## Step 3: Launch the game and enjoy
 
The final step is to launch the game and enjoy it in English. You can do this by opening the Epic Games Launcher and clicking on Batman: Arkham Asylum in your library. The game should start with English as its language and you should be able to understand everything in the game.
 
If you want to change the language to something else, you can repeat the steps above and use a different 3-letter code from the list below:
 
- DEU - German (text and audio)
- ESN - Spanish (text and audio)
- FRA - French (text and audio)
- ITA - Italian (text and audio)

Note that these are the only supported languages for Batman: Arkham Asylum. If you try to use a different code, the game will default to English.
 
## Conclusion
 
Batman: Arkham Asylum is a great game that deserves to be played in your preferred language. By following this simple guide, you can easily change the language of the game to English or any other supported language. We hope this article was helpful and informative for you.
